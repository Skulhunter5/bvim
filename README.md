# bvim
**bvim** stands for **better vim** and is just a stupid name that came to mind when I started. This does not mean that it's actually in any way better than vi/vim/nvim. I'm probably going to rename it once I come up with better name.

**bvim** is a modal terminal text editor written in Rust.

I'm writing this for educational purposes and fun. I don't know how far I'm going to develop it but maybe far enough to use it for some future projects.

## Goals for now
- [ ] **Opening multiple files**
- [ ] **Interactive commands** (e.g. when saving a new file)
- [ ] **Macros** (vim-like)
- [ ] **Advanced movement and editing actions** (Ctrl+D, Ctrl+U, Shift+A, O, Shift+O, ...)
- [ ] **Undo and redo**
- [ ] **Settings** (and therefore also a config file)
- [ ] *MAYBE* **multicursor**

## Goals for the distant future
- **syntax highlighting** (either for a few, basic languages or integrate an established system)
- **lsp support**
- **plugin extensibility** (like neovim with lua or vscode with javascript)
